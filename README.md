# Burger Kraken Website 
**Languages:** HTML / CSS / JavaScript

**URL:** https://patk80.github.io/Burger-Kraken-Website/

**Description:** A website I created for a fictional burger place in Seattle inspired by the NHL's new Seattle Kraken team. I wanted to challenge myself to create a functional navigation bar with JavaScript and expand upon my knowledge of CSS Grid and flexbox. Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
