      <h2>Ireland's Geography</h2>
      <div class="geography-section-main-content">
        <div>
          <p>Ireland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51° and 56° N, and longitudes 11° and 5° W. It is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres (14 mi) at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France. Ireland has a total area of 84,421 km2 (32,595 sq mi), of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent. Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles. As the term British Isles is controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term Britain and Ireland is often used as a neutral term for the islands.</p>
          <p>A ring of coastal mountains surround low plains at the centre of the island. The highest of these is Carrauntoohil (Irish: Corrán Tuathail) in County Kerry, which rises to 1,038 m (3,406 ft) above sea level. The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster. Western areas can be mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas. River Shannon, the island's longest river at 386 km (240 mi) long, rises in County Cavan in the north west and flows through Limerick in the mid west.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The harp is the national symbol of Ireland and not the shamrock. It is featured on the front of Irish passports <a href="https://www.irelandbeforeyoudie.com/50-shocking-facts-about-ireland-you-probably-didnt-know/" class="source-link" target="_blank">(Source)</a></li>
          <li>Halloween as we know it today actually originates from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when the people would light bonfires and wear scary costumes to ward off unwelcome spirits. Samhain is an old Gaelic word which translates to ‘darker half’, thus marking the beginning of winter <a href="https://www.skyscanner.ie/news/features/facts-about-ireland" class="source-link" target="_blank">(Source)</a></li>
          <li>Ireland's oldest pub is Sean's Bar in Athlone. It was founded some 900 years ago.

          <li>Irish land was not fit for grain agriculture until modern machinery and fertilizers of the 20th This is the main reason why potatoes were the staple food from the 17th Century and on <a href="https://www.thefactsite.com/ireland-facts/" class="source-link" target="_blank">(Source)</a></li>
          <li>Newgrange, which is classified as passage tomb or possibly an ancient temple, is 5,000 years old making it older than the ancient pyramid of Giza and Stonehenge <a href="https://www.globalexperiences.com/blog/12-fun-facts-about-ireland" class="source-link" target="_blank">(Source)</a></li>
